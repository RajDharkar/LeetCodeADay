## Notes

Seems kind of interesting, I'm trying to think why a stack would work here.

Seem's like a priority queue question, but that doesn't seem right.

Oh wait this is actually pretty simple, we can just go backwards through the array while storing, wait nvm

Oh I think I got it now, we can keep a stack of all the numbers that we haven't found and answer to while going up, then probobly something from there.

# cool it works but yeah

looked at he answers and I knew it that we can go backwards in the array somehow
