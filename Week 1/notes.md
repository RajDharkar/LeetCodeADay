## Week Notes

Overall this week seemed pretty easy. 

I think that learning how to use a dictionary and basic python syntax for this is really helping me. 

The use of a set/dictionary is really helpful especially for any sort of problem where mutliple things need to be detected. 

All in all, pretty good first week
