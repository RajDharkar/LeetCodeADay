## Notes

simple two pointer approach, we can keep a left pointer on the left side of the array, and a right pointer on the right side of the array, then we can repeatedly increase/decrease our sum until we get the desired answer by incrementing the left pointer or decrementing the right pointer.

Takeaway: sorted thing -> maybe two pointer.
