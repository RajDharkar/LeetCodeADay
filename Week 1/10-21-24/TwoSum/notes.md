## Problem Understanding
- **Summary**: Given an array and a target, find the two values in the array that sum up to the target
- **Input**: An array and a target, which is an integer
- **Output**: The positions of the two numbers that add up to target.

## Approach
- **Initial Thoughts**: I've seen this one before, I can either use two pointers, a hashset, or the brute force it.
- **Approach Taken**: HashSet due to its time complexity.

<!-- ## Approach 2

- **Approach Taken**: 
- **Why This Approach**:  -->

## Challenges
- **Obstacles Faced**: 
- **Edge Cases**: None

## Optimization
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), O(1) * n * 2
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), one set with size of n

## Alternative Solutions
- Sorting and using two pointers
- Brute forcing over all values.

## Key Takeaways
- Demonstration of using a set when two values correlate to each other.
