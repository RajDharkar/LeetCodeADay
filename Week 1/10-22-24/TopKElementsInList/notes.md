## Notes are unneccessary, read quick summary below
**We can just use a counter map but with a tree set and then loop backwards to find the Top K most frequent elements**

## Time Complexity
**O(n log n)** - We can just loop through every element and add it to the map, then loop backwards through the map to find the top J
