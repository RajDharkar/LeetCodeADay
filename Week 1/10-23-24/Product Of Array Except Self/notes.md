## Notes 

To start off, after reading the question, it seems that my answer array needs to just be the product??

Ok I understand now, quite a weird question, wait why can't i just do some trickery for this.

Just compute the product of the whole array and then divide by nums[i]

Ok this took a bit longer than expected, this is because my code is such troll LMAO.
My edge case implementation for zero is just terrible, but it works and 

tc = O(n)
space complexity = O(1), other than array so i beat that challenge!

just read editorial and realized how cooked my sol was, idk how people didn't think of this but funny.

shouldve used a prefix product array and a suffix product array, weird question though.
